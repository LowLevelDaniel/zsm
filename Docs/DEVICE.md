# Device Implementation
A Device constists of an architecture and an identifier, <br>
the architecture determins how it is used, <br>
while the identifier seperates from other devices. <br>
The Host can be used as a device if wanted (the Host is the default device) <br>
<br>
A Device can be selected by using ':' after your statement, <br>
and then giving the unique identifier (best done with macros), <br>
i.e mv $RDI, 10 : $GPU ; <br>
